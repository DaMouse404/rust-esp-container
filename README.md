# Rust ESP compiler container ![publish](https://github.com/DaMouse404/rust-esp-container/workflows/publish/badge.svg)

This is a container which can be used to build a Rust project for the ESP32.

## Pre-requisites

  * Docker
  * A rust project (e.g. use [ctron/rust-esp-template](https://github.com/ctron/rust-esp-template) as example)

## Usage

This container image provides a few tools which can be run like this:

    docker run -ti -v $PWD:/home/project:z quay.io/ctron/rust-esp:latest

This uses `-ti` to attach the console, to show you the output and let you interact
with the application running inside the container.

**Note**: Consider running the container with `--rm` as well. This prevents Docker
          from keeping the container around after it exited. As all your sources are
          mapped from the host's file system into the container, you don't need to
          keep the container on disk, and can safe some disk storage.

### Volume mapping

The `-v $PWD:/home/project:z` will map the current directory into the location
`/home/project` inside the container. This is required so that the tools inside
the container can work with the project.

`$PWD` gets replaced by the shell with the current directory. This will only work
in a Bourne like shell. On Windows you can use `%CD%` instead. You can of course
also replace this with the absolute path to your project.

You can drop the `:z` suffix, if you don't have SElinux on the host system.

All following examples use `$PWD:/home/project:z`, replace this as required by your environment.

### Default command

This will run the default command `build-project`. This will try an automic full build, see below.

You can run other commands by providing a command manually:

    docker run -ti -v $PWD:/home/project:z quay.io/ctron/rust-esp my-command-in-the-container

### Running as shell

As you can run other commands, and the container is just a normal Linux, you can simply run `bash`
in the container and directly work there. Without the need to run docker with each command:

    docker run -ti -v $PWD:/home/project:z quay.io/ctron/rust-esp bash

### Tags

The `master` branch of this repository will build into the `latest` tag, which is also the default
if you omit the `:latest` suffix in the container name.

Each git tag will also be build into a container image tag, so e.g. git tag `0.0.1`, will be built into
the container tag `:0.0.1`.

So should the `latest` image break, it should always be possible to switch to a previous version.

There is also the `:develop` tag, which is based on the `develop` branch in Git. It is used to try
out new changes before merging into master.

## Bootstrapping

Initially a few files need to be set up. The ESP-IDF components need to be configured and compiled.
Run the following command to create an initial setup:

    docker run -ti -v $PWD:/home/project:z quay.io/ctron/rust-esp create-project

This will create (overwrite) a few files, which are required to build the project.

Next run:

    docker run -ti -v $PWD:/home/project:z quay.io/ctron/rust-esp make menuconfig

Which will start the ESP-IDF build and shows you the menu config tool for configuring
your ESP project. Be sure to save when you exit.

## Building

In order to build the project, run the following command:

    docker run -ti -v $PWD:/home/project:z quay.io/ctron/rust-esp build-project

This will compile the ESP-IDF part, the rust part and finally convert it to an image
which you can upload to your ESP.

## Uploading

You can then upload the image using the `flash-project` executable:

    docker run -ti --device=/dev/ttyUSB0 -v $PWD:/home/project:z rust-esp32 flash-project

If this doesn't work or you need to use differnt tool it might be easier to
upload the image via `esptool` from the host machine. To do this call:

    esptool write_flash 0x10000 esp-app.bin

## Building the container

You can also build the container image yourself, by cloning this repository and executing:

    docker build . -t rust-esp

## Notes

  * Use this at your own risk. No guarantees.
  * Contributions are welcome.
  * This /should/ work on MacOS the same way. But I haven't tested it.
  * A test on Windows shows that, yes it works. But with some quirks:
    * The menu `make menuconfig` renders a bit weird. The new Windows terminal improves this a lot.
    * The first `make app` will run just fine, but after that it fails to compile. Maybe some
      issue with the Windows CIFS mapping in Docker. However, you can skip this step and run `xbuild-project`
      instead. That will only compile the rust part.
  * In theory this should work also with with the ESP8266. A few tweaks for the build files
    will be required, and I didn't test this.
  * I put this on [quay.io](https:/quay.io) as Docker Hub continously failed to build this
    image. After several hours, the build times out. As quay.io now runs out of disk space during
    the build, I started building this with GitHub Actions, and then push it to quay.io.
